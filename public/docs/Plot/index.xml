      <description>Sankey diagram A Sankey Diagram is a popular data visualization for data flows display. For example, hospitals from better, average, worse performance categories can fall into different performance categories after quality improvement efforts. A Sankey diagram can be used to display such a change in categories. The categorical buckets (nodes) are represented by boxes or text at each column in the plot. The transition across nodes are connected by links.</description>

      <description>Odds Ratio Forest Plot Odds ratios from logistic models are often present using forest plots. Given the coefficients of logistic models are exponentiated to obtain the odds ratios, odds ratios are NOT symmetric on a linear scale. For example,a change from an odds ratio between 0.4 and 0.5 is the same relative change (25% increase) as that between 2.0 and 2.5. But on the linear scale the difference is 0.</description>
