<p>Data example: Mixed effect model was simulated using parameters obtained from a pilot data. Intraclass correlation coefficient was calculated from the mixed effect model to test the agreement between raters. In this example, videos as the subjects were assessed by different raters, each rater will be assigned to multiple videos. nstand is parameter for the number of videos which will be assessed by various raters (nraters). Given the variation of the rating can be attributed to videos and raters. The mixed effect model in this simulation included videos and raters as two separate random intercepts. Intraclass correlation is calculated from the models with the simulated data. We varied the number of videos in the simulation. The ICC distribution plot from the simulated data showed that 60 videos has reached a more accurate estimate for ICC with the narrower range.</p>
